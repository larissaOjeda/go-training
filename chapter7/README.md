# Chapter 7 - OSS @ Beat

## [Patron](https://github.com/beatlabs/patron)

Patron is a microservice framework. More details can be found in the repository or the [documentation page](https://beatlabs.github.io/patron/).  
The examples folder contains various examples of usages that are runnable.
All of them rely on some infrastructure for which we provided a `docker-compose.yml` file.
In the examples folder there is also a `make` file that runs the examples and verifies the outcome as part of our e2e tests.

## [Harvester](https://github.com/beatlabs/harvester)

`Harvester` is a configuration library which helps setting up and monitoring configuration values in order to dynamically reconfigure your application.
